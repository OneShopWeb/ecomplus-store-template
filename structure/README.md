# Introduction
Such as with any other web static application, you are free to
set up your own directory structure to your E-Com Plus store template,
it should work as storefront.

This document is only intended to define few file and directories names
to make the template fully compatible with E-Com Plus dashboard tools.

Before you start building your template,
you must also read (at least) the storefront
